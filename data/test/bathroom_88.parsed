844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was marble and we had luxurious bathrobes and really, every detail attended to.

844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	otherwise the bathroom was decent enough, decent temperature and decent water pressure.

844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the room was small, with a king bed, and a truly claustrophobic bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	amenities, while this hotel is n't a luxury property, they have some nice touches like marble bathrooms, mini bar, room service and an evening wine reception every day.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was clean, well lit, and always well stocked with shampoo etc and towels.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the only odd thing was the bathroom door and room door opened outwards into the room and hallway respectively.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	room spacious 2 double beds gave us plenty of room, the beds were comfortable and the bathroom was a good size.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was large and included a mounted makeup mirror.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the rooms are abit smallish, but immaculately maintained, and tastefully decorated, with excellent bathroom facilities.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	shower bathroom was good with good shower and plenty of space.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	both the bedroom and bathroom had plenty of room.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	large clean bathrooms fully stocked with everything needed.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	however, when we arrived at our room there was a maintenance worker there measuring the bathroom counter, so maybe they 're doing work in some units.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the room was large and very comfortable with a nice large bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	there is a wall, mounted hair dryer in the bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the thing that bothered me the most was the bathroom was very dated.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	there is virtually no counterspace in the bathroom at all.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	upon our arrival, there was a slight odor in bathroom but nothing worth complaining about.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was adequate with thick, fluffy towels.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was large and private.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was very clean and well appointed with nice towels and toiletries, it was not big, but room enough to do what one needs to.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the tuscan inn room was quite nicely appointed, the bed was comfortable the chairs tv adequate, the bathroom reasonably good.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	my only real complaint would be that the bathroom does not have a separate vanity area, so 2 people getting dressed had to improvise, which was kind of surprising since the bathrooms were all redone on 2005.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the clever use of mirrors behind the bed helped to create the illusion of space, however, in reality the room was cramped and with two of us trying to use the hand basin and bathroom at the same time was particularly awkward.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom containing the toilet and the shower was also very small, not to mention the sink and counter directly outside of it.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	turning the bathroom light on also turns the counter light on, meaning a middle, of, the, night trip to the bathroom means the whole side of the room gets illuminated and the wooden shutters that were installed in place of traditional curtains to add to the hotel 's theme do absolutely nothing to keep the room dark once the sun comes up.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the room was a good size but the bathroomm was very small.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	bathroom was adequate and clean and there was a hairdryer.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the wash basin was in the room without any privacy and there was a small bathroom for the toilet and bath shower.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom had not been remodeled in alignment, but it was all very clean and perfectly acceptable.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom had several problems.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	bathrooms were also very nice.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the shower stall could have been bigger as the bathroom itself was pretty large.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	then they gave us a room which had a view of a wall, a tiny bathroom so small in fact that the sink had to be in the bedroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the room is not the most modern room but there was tons of space especially in the bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	we may have had an ada room because it was pretty big with large bathroom, it was room 459, and the room had all the amenities we were looking for.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the room and bathroom were perfect in size, just what is needed.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the only possible complaint was that the sink in the bathroom had a crack in it, but it did not bother me enough to ask for a different room.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	bathrooms, though, are plenty big.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	although the rooms were clean and fresh, one of ours had several small problems, the phone did n't work, the bathroom door handle was quite loose, and the thermostat did n't work properly.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	it represents value for money, the rooms and bathrooms were impeccably clean, fresh linen daily, and the staff extremely helpful and friendly.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	there were plenty of thick towels in the bathroom, and all the usual toiletries, hair, dryer, etc.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	i really did n't get a chance to experience the staff 's level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was also small it was difficult to close the door once inside to avoid the door hitting you no joke !
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	some rooms had the bathroom sink outside the bathroom, which we would have preferred, but our sink was inside the bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was clean and bright and the toiletries were so good that we took the leftovers home because there was a website selling the shampoo listed on the bottle.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the rooms were very nice, could of use just a little more shelf space by the bathroom sink.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was clean but a little dated.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the only thing wrong with the room was the bathroom, it was not up to the standard of the rest of the decor but it was clean and large enough.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom was just okay, but for the price we survived.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	hair dryer in bathroom constantly fell in sink from it 's holder when anyone used the door to our room.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the reasonable price of the hotel allowed us to book 2 rooms, thus giving the 4 of us a bit more space and 2 bathrooms.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	plenty of room in the bathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	nice clean rooms and a spaciousbathroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the only minor downside, as a few others have mentioned, is the bathroom sink lighting.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	did not like the bathroom light shining into bedroom.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	only negative is the bathroom area is a little small.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	our suite we had was small there was pubic hair on the bathroom floor from ?
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	bathroom a little on the older side.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathroom needed a face, lift also.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the bathrooms are quite small compared to other hotels but adequate.
844567893014728704	null	1490192051000	18498934	the hotel was of a good standard, big clean rooms, decent bathroom and the free wine reception in the evening was an added bonus.
